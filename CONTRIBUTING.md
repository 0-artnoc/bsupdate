At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

#### 4. Check The Application Runtime 

Try running the utility and check the four test cases 
* What happens when you respond no to the update (the update shouldn't occur)
* What happens when your internet is off and you try to run the utility (it should show an error saying there is no internet)
* What happens when you say yes to the update (it should update the configured application)
* What happens when you run the utility on an application where an update is available (it should ask the user if they want to update)
* What happens when you run the utility on an application where an update isn't available (it should ware you that you already have the latest version)

#### 6. Create A Pull Request

First make sure to commit and push your changes to your forked repository. 
Check to see if there are any conflicts with the main repository and your fork.
